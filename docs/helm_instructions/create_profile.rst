The command will also configure a location where artifacts resulting
from Kanister data operations such as backup should go. This is stored as a
``profiles.cr.kanister.io`` *CustomResource (CR)* which is then referenced in
Kanister ActionSets. Every ActionSet requires a Profile reference whether one
created as part of the application install or not. Support for creating a
Profile as part of install is simply for convenience. This CR can be shared
between Kanister-enabled application instances so one option is to only
create as part of the first instance.

.. note:: Prior to creating the Profile CR, you will need to do the following:

   * Create a bucket for artifacts on your S3 store. This will be your
     ``location.bucket`` parameter to the command.
   * Obtain ``aws.accessKey`` and ``aws.secretKey`` credentials for an
     account with access to the bucket that you will use.
   * Configure the permissions on the bucket to allow the account to
     list, put, get, and delete.
   * Make sure that your retention policy allows deletions so that artifacts
     can be reclaimed based on your intended data backup retention.

.. note:: The ``location.endpoint`` parameter is only required if you are using an
   S3-compatible provider different from AWS.

   If you are using an on-premises s3 provider, the endpoint specified needs be
   accessible from within your Kubernetes cluster.

   If, in your environment, the endpoint has a self-signed SSL certificate,
   include ``--set verifySSL=false`` in the above command to disable SSL
   verification for the S3 operations in the blueprint.
